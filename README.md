# AUTOMATED-PASSWORD-CRACKER
The optimized password cracker tool will utilize advanced techniques and algorithms to efficiently crack passwords encrypted using  various hashing algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, and bcrypt. 
# Key Features
# User Interface:
Flask Web Application: A simple and intuitive web interface built with Flask, allowing users to upload files and view results.
File Upload Functionality: Users can upload a dump file containing hashed passwords and potential plaintext passwords.
# Hashing Algorithms:
SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm): Demonstrates the use of SHA algorithms (e.g., SHA-1, SHA-256) for hashing passwords.
bcrypt: Uses bcrypt for hashing and compares its security advantages over SHA, including salting and its computational difficulty.
# Password Cracking Techniques:
Dictionary Attack: Uses a dictionary of common passwords to attempt to crack hashed passwords by comparing them to the uploaded hashes.
Brute Force Attack: Implements brute force methods to generate possible passwords and compare their hashes to the provided ones.
# Optimizations:
Parallel Processing: Utilizes Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing capabilities to speed up the password cracking process.
Efficient Algorithms: Incorporates optimized algorithms and data structures to reduce the time complexity of the cracking process.
# Security Demonstration:
Salting: Shows the importance of salting in password security by comparing the difficulty of cracking salted vs. unsalted hashes.
Hash Strength Comparison: Provides insights into the relative strengths of different hashing algorithms and their vulnerability to various attack methods.
# Technical Implementation
Python: The core language used for implementing hashing, password generation, and the cracking algorithms.
Flask: Powers the web interface, handling file uploads, user interactions, and displaying results.
Hashlib: A Python library for implementing various SHA algorithms.
bcrypt: A library specifically designed for secure password hashing, demonstrating its use in contrast to SHA.
# How It Works
User Interaction:

The user accesses the web interface and uploads a dump file containing example passwords and their corresponding hashes.
The file is parsed, and the hashes and potential passwords are extracted for processing.
Hash Cracking Process:

The application attempts to crack each hash using the provided dictionary of passwords.
If the dictionary attack fails, the application resorts to brute force methods.
Throughout the process, bcrypt's effectiveness in resisting these attacks compared to SHA is demonstrated.
# Result Display:

Once the cracking process is complete, the results are displayed on the web interface.
Users can see which passwords were successfully cracked and the time taken for each attempt, highlighting the efficiency of the different methods and algorithms used.
Use Cases
Educational Tool: Ideal for students and security enthusiasts to learn about password hashing, security, and cracking techniques.
Security Awareness: Demonstrates the importance of using strong, salted hashes for password storage and the vulnerabilities of weak hashing methods.
Research: Provides a platform for researchers to experiment with and optimize various password cracking techniques.
